
Here are popular questions related to asynchronous JavaScript, along with short and simple answers:

What is asynchronous programming in JavaScript?

It allows code to run without blocking the execution of other code. For example, you can fetch data from a server while other parts of your code keep running.
What are callbacks in JavaScript?

A function passed as an argument to another function, which is executed after the first function completes. Example:
javascript
Copy code
setTimeout(() => { console.log('Done!'); }, 1000);
What is the problem with callback hell?

When callbacks are nested inside other callbacks, making the code hard to read and maintain.
What are Promises in JavaScript?

A promise represents a value that will be available in the future. It can be resolved (success), rejected (failure), or pending (still in progress).
How do you create a promise in JavaScript?

Example:
javascript
Copy code
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Do something, then call resolve() or reject()
});
What is async and await in JavaScript?

async makes a function return a promise, and await pauses the execution until the promise resolves. Example:
javascript
Copy code
async function fetchData() {
  let data = await fetch('url');
  console.log(data);
}
What is the difference between Promise.then() and async/await?

Promise.then() handles promises with chained callbacks, while async/await makes asynchronous code look more like regular code, making it easier to read.
How can you handle errors in promises?

Use .catch() for promises and try...catch with async/await. Example:
javascript
Copy code
fetch('url').then().catch(error => console.log(error));
What is the purpose of Promise.all()?

It runs multiple promises in parallel and returns results when all promises resolve or one rejects. Example:
javascript
Copy code
Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(results => console.log(results));
What is Promise.race() in JavaScript?

It runs multiple promises but resolves as soon as the first promise settles (resolves or rejects).
What is event loop in JavaScript?

It's how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations, processing events in a queue and allowing non-blocking I/O operations.
What is microtask and macrotask in JavaScript?

Microtasks (like promises) have higher priority and run before macrotasks (like setTimeout) in the event loop.
